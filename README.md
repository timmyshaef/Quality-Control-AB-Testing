# Quality A/B Testing for Microphone Standardization

## Goal
The objective of this A/B testing project was to solidify quality standards for microphone testing and establish a uniform process that anyone could follow. Previously, the testing process relied solely on subjective human judgment, leading to inconsistencies. By implementing control units and a data-driven approach, we ensured a standardized, repeatable testing method.

## Experiment Design
- **Product Tested**: Microphones
- **Control Units**: One unit per product SKU was designated as the control, based on rigorous verification against technical and build specifications.
- **Test Groups**: Future production units were tested against these control units.

### Key Metrics
- **Binary Test**: Does the unit produce sound? (Pass/Fail)
- **Qualitative Test**: Audio signal quality, previously judged subjectively.

## Challenges & Data Validation
One of the biggest challenges was that audio quality is inherently qualitative. To address this, we:
- Researched detailed product specifications to confirm the exact expected performance.
- Developed a structured procedure to compare future units against the control, reducing reliance on individual tester discretion.

## Results & Business Impact
- Established a **company-wide quality-controlled testing procedure** that could be used by any employee, ensuring consistency.
- Eliminated inconsistencies from subjective testing, leading to more reliable product evaluations.
- Allowed for **scalability** in the testing process without requiring specialized expertise.
